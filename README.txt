All submitted files and their content:
	1. Python code: All the Python code that we developed for this project.
	2. Dataset: The dataset we collected, as well as a file detailing the source of each image.
	3. README: A readme.txt that lists all submitted files, instructions to run our code.
	4. Report: The project report, as detailed in the project description, in PDF format.

How to run our code:
	python main.py

	If you only want to run training, only call the "train_phase()" method in main.py; the train phase will be carried out, and the training model will be saved to "net.pkl" and "net_params.pkl", which could be read by later testing phase.
	If you only want to run testing, only call the "test_phase()" method in main.py;

	By running "python main.py", our code will automatically generate the evaluation results provided in the report, including a table of results showing the accuracy, precision, recall and F1-measure printed in console, as well as a confusion matrix in both the console (plain version) and the pop up window (graphical version).
